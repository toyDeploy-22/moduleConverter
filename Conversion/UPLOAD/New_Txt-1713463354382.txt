# Strive Blog API

- [Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7356000/TzRYc4mk)

You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

[Here](https://github.com/ubeytdemirr/strive-blog-template) you can find the Frontend already created

In this first "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog authors.

- Authors should have following information:

```
name
surname
ID (Unique and server generated)
email
date of birth
avatar (e.g. https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=John+Doe)

```

- The backend should include the following routes:

```
GET /authors => returns the list of authors
GET /authors/123 => returns a single author
POST /authors => create a new author
PUT /authors/123 => edit the author with the given id
DELETE /authors/123 => delete the author with the given id

```

The persistence **must** be granted via file system

(es.: Json file with a list of authors inside)

⚠️ Sidenote:

remember to install the cors package with 'npm i cors', to import it with the require statement and to use it with 'server.use(cors())'

### Extra

```
POST /checkEmail => check if another author has the same email. The parameter should be passed in the body. It should return true or false.

It should not be possible to add a new author (with POST /authors) if another has the same email.


```
